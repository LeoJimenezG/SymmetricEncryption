# SymmetricEncryption
Object Oriented Code for Symmetric Encryption

-- How does it work --

The class "SymmetricEncryption" will have only two functions:
- symmetric_encrypt_AES_CTR(): which will be used for encrypting a message in a bytes format.
- symmetric_decrypt_AES_CTR(): which will be used for decrypting a message in a bytes format.

This code uses the Advenced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to generate the secret key. Also, it uses the Counter Mode (CTR).
The secret key size is set to 32 bytes and the initialization vector is set to 16 bytes.

Feel free to make any needed changes.
